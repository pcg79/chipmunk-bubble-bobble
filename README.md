Chipmunk Bubble Bobble Demo
===========================

It's a simple demo done for RiojaParty 2011 (a LAN party in La Rioja, Spain). With this demo I wanted to show how easy is to use [Chipmunk](http://beoran.github.com/chipmunk/).

This demo is a bubble bobble stage as background where our green star can shoot bubbles that go up until dissapear.


Controls
--------

The following keys let you interact with the environment:

* <space> shoot bubbles
* <esc> quit "game"
* <up> increment gravity
* <down> increment gravity
* <left> decrement impulse
* <right> increment impulse
* <PageUp> increment volume
* <PageDown> decrement volume


Hints and some concepts
-----------------------

At the top of the screen you can read gravity and impulse current values.

About gravity:

* Positive values make bubbles fall down
* Negative values make bubbles go up
* 0 value make them to float :)

Impulse is the force used to shoot the bubbles. High values make greater distances, negative values have the contrary effect.
